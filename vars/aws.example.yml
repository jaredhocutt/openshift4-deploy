# The OpenShift version to install.
#
# The version must include the z-stream (e.g.4.4.3)
#
# The list of versions can be found at
# http://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/

# This value will be in your DNS entries and should conform to valid DNS

# The AMI ID for RHCOS.
#
# If you are deploying into a commercial AWS region, the AMI ID can be found
# here. Be sure the documentation you are looking at matches the version of
# OpenShift you are deploying to get the correct AMI IDs.
#
# If you are deploying in AWS GovCloud, you will need to upload the RHCOS image
# and create your own AMI. After doing so, you can use that AMI ID for this
# variable. You can find details for creating a RHCOS AMI here.
#
# The intention is to add support to have this variable default to a sensible
# value, but at the moment you will need to provide the AMI ID.
